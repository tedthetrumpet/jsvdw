I was round at Eddie's house the other day, and we had a go at circuit bending an old Yamaha RX17 drum machine;

This is pretty standard stuff, a well-known bend linking pins 4 and 12 of IC 116. After some experimentation, we decided on a 100k log pot with a 1k resistor in series. Ed is a bit iffy about the whole idea of circuit-bending, kind of goes against the grain for someone who was trained in electronic engineering! But we had fun - going to use this in [the show on March 5th](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=51039697335).
