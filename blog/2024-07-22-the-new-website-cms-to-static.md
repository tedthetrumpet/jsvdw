So here it is: the new _static_ version of jsimonvanderwalt.com!

My [first website](https://web.archive.org/web/20010720095108/http://www.jsimonvanderwalt.com/) was started around 2001 and was hand-coded in html.

Sometime in 2013-ish I moved to WordPress, a database-driven CMS. After messing around for a while with hosting wp myself, I got fed-up with constantly self-managing updates and security issues and decided just to pay for wordpress.com.

As the web developed, I became less and less fond of wordpress. I _hated_ the block-based Gutenberg editor, which is just frustrating for someone who already ^ thinks in html.

Around 2014 I started [livecoding](/blog/tags/livecode). Through my involvement in that scene, I became aware of two things: [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), and the idea of a 'static' website, like the ones that I was seeing used for [documentation](https://tidalcycles.org/) of domain-specific languages for music. Markdown was perfect for me: for years I have anyway been in the habit of doing all of my writing first of all in BBEdit, with markdown-like shortcuts for bullets, headings and emphases.

Finally: one of the main purposes of this website is as a repository for around [30 years of creative work](/catalog) as a musician. Having this as a static website means that I can host a lot of the actual content – particularly .pdf files and audio – as part of the site itself, rather than relying on external silos. I have some reason to hope that, when I'm no longer around, all the stuff that I have made will still 'be there' in some coherent form.
