Over the winter break, I've been working on some new music for gamelan. Following on from Naga Mas' rather spectacular success with our gamelan-in-outer-space piece [Gamelan Untethered](http://www.nagamas.co.uk/about-us/history/), we have plans to do something along the same lines, but this time on an underwater theme. Below is a midi demo of something I'm working on for the group: a sort of sampak/kebyar fusion piece, pulling together some of the livelier ideas from the Javanese traditions with a Balinese-inspired melody.

This may prove a little tricky to play!
