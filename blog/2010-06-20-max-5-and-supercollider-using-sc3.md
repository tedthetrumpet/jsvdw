Another way of doing it, using the [sc3~ object](http://music.columbia.edu/%7Ebrad/sc3%7E/). I can't quite make up my mind at the moment which is the way forward; this way it looks like you'd have to develop your code in [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/), then paste it into Max and hope it still works… have a feeling the OSC bridging method is more generally useful, for instance, could use it with Pd as well. On the other hand, this way it's all together in the one patch in a single program, to run it you don't need SC installed, probably a lot easier to deal with when you come back to it in five years time…
