Having some free time over the Easter break, and in preparation for taking part in a performance of Cage's _Musicircus_ at Tramway on 30 May, I've been playing with the Lexicon MPX 100 effects unit which Allan Neave gave me, feeding it back into itself, which works particularly nicely on the pitch-shift-plus-delay patches. At the same time I've been working on a Max patch which drifts five-note chords gradually through a modulating set of hexatonic regions, soâ€¦ without really meaning to, I ended up putting together a sort of ambient track combing the two;
