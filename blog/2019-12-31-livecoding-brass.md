As 2019 draws to a close, I’m spending some time getting ready for the [International Conference on Livecoding](http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/2020/) in February in Limerick. I put in two proposals. The first of these was to be called The ‘All-Pressure No-Method’ System, and would have involved me working with four live brass players. I say ‘would have’: this has had to be abandoned, we were not able to fund the travel and accomodation for the players.

The central idea, however, is one I’d like to return to. Inspired particularly by the [work of Kate Sicchio in livecoding dancers](https://www.sicchio.com/hacking.html), the intention was to livecode the brass players by means of a repertoire of typed and projected instructions. Here’s a demo video of the concept:
