## 21/5/02 for pelog gamelan

This may be the most *un*popular piece I have ever written! In June of 2002, Gamelan Naga Mas, dalang Joko Susilo and Matthew Isaac Cohen worked together to create the _wayang sandosa_ 'Cuchulain' at Gilmorehill G12. Lured in by the veryâ€¦ _demotic_ approach Joko and Matthew were taking, I came up with this idea for a really rather stunningly tastless pelog blues.

I can't seem to find the bonang part at the moment - not that we'd ever want to play this again. Probably.
