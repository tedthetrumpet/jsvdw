## 28/5/97 for pelog gamelan & jazz soloist

In some ways my most succesful and often performed piece, using the pelog gamelan to fake various jazzy chords & riffs, based on the rough proximity to normal concert pitches. Purists may throw their hands up in horror at this, and they may well be right; nevertheless, the result is a popular and accessible number.

Performed by Gamelan Naga Mas with myself as soloist on many occasions.

Duration ~6'
