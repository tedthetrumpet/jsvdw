[ellaberintor.mp3](pathname:///catalog/ellaberintor.mp3)\
Reconstruction of my original midi demo, using vintage Casio GZ-50M sounds, Logic 4 file updated to version 9 (!) (5'15, 7.1 MB)



### Composer's note

Heavy tune! Jah Wobble style bass line, quartal string pad wash, quartal/polymodal melody with unpredictable phrase lengths. The title means 'The labyrinth of my mind'. (It could be worse; I once wrote a tune called 'El limpiaparabrisas del alma' which means 'The windscreen-wipers of the soul'...)

### Notes

Performed twice by El Cometa Allstars.

Duration ~5'15
