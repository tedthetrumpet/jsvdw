### About

The title means 'The Tomb of F', although 'tumba' also refers to the lower of a a pair of conga drums. In fact, this is the only tune I have ever written on the conga drums; it was inspired by the first phrases I made up on acquiring a third conga in my set.

First performed by the Salsa Celtica Big Band 20/11/98, also (small band version) by the El Cometa Allstars on various occasions.

Duration ~6'
