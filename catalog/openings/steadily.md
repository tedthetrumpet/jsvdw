### Notes

Steadily-stop! is a rhythmic sentence designed to be used in devising contexts where an easily memorisable and rhythmically interesting passage would be useful. It has found a place in many of my works; with the gamelan, the Society for High Art Music and in the [Society for Classical and Authentic Music](../contemporary/scam), as well as proving useful in many teaching and workshop situations.

The [complete version](/steadily_2k11.pdf) of the score adds conventional notation to the above, outlines how to teach the piece to a group, and suggests a way of using the piece as a stand alone composition.
