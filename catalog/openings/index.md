# Openings

These are flexible bits of musical material, to re-use; sometimes as stand-alone pieces, more often as part of a bigger piece. Many of them appear as part of other works.

- [Adrift & Afloat](/catalog/openings/adrift) for gamelan (or anything) (score, recordings)
- [Circularthing](/catalog/openings/circular "CIRCULARTHING") for High Art Ensemble (or anything) (score, recording)
