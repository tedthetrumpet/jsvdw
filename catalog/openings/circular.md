### Notes

The graphic above is, in a sense, the score for CIRCULARTHING, with nothing more to be said. However, this score does have aâ€¦ performing tradition associated with it, which is outlined in [the complete version of the score](pathname:///catalog/circularthing.pdf "CIRCULARTHING").

This piece was a part of the repertoire of the street-art project **The Society for High Art Music**, and was originally for two tenor horns and two trombones. It has since been incorportad in several other works, including [Othing](../contemporary/othing) and [The Society for Classical and Authentic](../contemporary/scam/) music.

CIRCULARTHING features in the book [Notations 21](https://search.worldcat.org/title/Notations-21/oclc/335646420) by Theresa Sauer (p260)

Duration ~4'33
