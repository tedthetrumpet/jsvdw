# Catalog of works

I have somewhat arbitrarily divided my works into six categories:

* [Contemporary](contemporary) – 'serious', 'classical-contemporary' compositions, mostly score-based.
* [Openings](openings) – flexible bits of musical material, to re-use; sometimes as stand-alone pieces, more often as part of a bigger piece. Many of them appear as part of other works.
* [Gamelan](gamelan) – many of these pieces have been created for and with Naga Mas, the Glasgow Gamelan Group.
* [Jazz, latin, traditional](jazzetc) – What it say :)
* [Also](also) – work that doesn't easily fit anywhere else, including collaborations, installations, electronics, and theatre.
* [Archive](archive) – pieces I feel perhaps less fond of now, but I'm keeping for nostalgic reasons :)
