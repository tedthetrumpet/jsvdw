## 19/9/98 for four piccolos

![Extract from score](/img/piccs.png "piccs")

### Composer's note

Four little piccolo-birds going about their own business, calling their own distinctive calls, meet up at the lilac bush one day, and decide to do a little jig together. After a while they get bored with each other's company, and flutter off into the undergrowth again.

Thanks to Alexander Hay for suggesting the idea of 'a light piece for four piccolos'.
