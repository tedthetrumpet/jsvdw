### Composer's note

The text for this piece is taken from the Tascam 424 Portastudio manual, p.37;

> Be sure to concentrate while you are degaussing. Don't try to hold a conversation of think of anything else but the job you are doing. If the degausser is turned on or off by accicent while it is near the heads, you may put a permanent magnetic charge on them that no amount of careful degaussing will remove. You will have to get the heads replaced. Make sure you are wide awake for this job.

I liked it so much I just had to set it to music!
