#### Composer's note

I wrote this piece at a time when I was seeking answers myself. I found them – through writing this piece, although, in retrospect, it feels like I maybe was asking the wrong questions.

Three other points which may be of interest; the strings are deliberately subordinate, the timps deliberately prominent and… the fact that it is apparently in sonata form is an accident. Probably.
