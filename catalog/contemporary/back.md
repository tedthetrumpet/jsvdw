### Composer's note

A study towards, or perhaps a tangent to, [The Other Other Hand](tooh.html). It is composed of four building blocks; _Ascending Material_ for the clarinets; _Sick Puppy_, a limping gesture for three flutes; _Sick Puppy Variations_; which adds a bass clarinet to the flutes; and a march. A fourth gesture _Dodgy Dog_ didn't make the cut.

### Notes

Performed by **The Scottish Flute Trio** (Laura Bailie, Janet Larsson and Ruth Morley) with the clarinet choir of the RSAMD operating under the guise of 'The Society for High Art Music'; Abraham González Chávez and Amy Strachan (Eb clarinets), Kim Stephen (Leader), Cristina Montesdeoca Suárez, Matthew Rogers, Tom Logan, Rebecca Humphreys, Lisa Duggan (Bb clarinets), Ursula Was and Calum Robertson (A clarinets), Fraser Antony Max Langton (basset horn) and Samuel Hernández Ávila and Yla Garvie (bass clarinets).
