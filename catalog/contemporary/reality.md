## 29/10/97 for loud ensemble and assistant conductor

### Score

A conceptual piece, in the form of a text. Here is the complete score;

> Reality Intrudes Upon the Comfort of the Rich  
> for Loud Ensemble and Assistant Conductor  
> by J. Simon van der Walt 29/10/97
> 
> Overview
> 
> This text comprises the full score for 'Reality Intrudes Upon the Comfort of the Rich', by J. Simon van der Walt. A loud ensemble of instruments share the platform with a classical ensemble during a concert or recital of classical music. Periodically, led by cues from an assistant conductor, the ensemble perform one of three loud 'intrusions'. These may occur at any time; preferably during favourite melodies, poignant moments etc of the other ensemble. This activity continues throughout the concert.
> 
> Forces
> 
> The work requires a 'loud ensemble'. Unpitched instruments and voices are excluded. I suggest at least five instruments drawn from the following list;  
>   
> Piccolo  
> Oboe  
> Any saxophone (hard jazz/pop sound, not classical)  
> Trumpet  
> Trombone  
> Tuba  
> Electric fiddle, viola, cello  
> Electric bass  
> Electric guitar (all electric instruments must be individually amplified)
> 
> Assistant conductor
> 
> The assistant conductor rehearses the ensemble intrusions, and cues them in during performance. They should be infrequent and few in number; an entire piece or movement may be allowed to pass without interruption. Please feel free to intrude upon solo entrances, heartfelt slow movements, endings, audience applause etc.
> 
> Intrusions
> 
> There are three possible intrusions, which are cued in by hand signals (scissors, paper, stone) by the assistant conductor. As a preparation, the ensemble instrumentalists should write out, in an appropriate range for their instrument, two octaves or so, descending, of the following two scales;  
> Octatonic scale; C Bb A G Gb E Eb Db C  
> Augmented scale; C A Ab E Eb C
> 
> Intrusion 1; hand symbol 'paper'  
> Fortissimo possible  
> Choose either scale  
> Start on any note and descend approx 2 octaves; omit notes as desired  
> Start quickly but then rall. molto  
> Start together on cue, but thereafter do not synchronise with other players  
> Tenuto or legato
> 
> Intrusion 2; hand symbol 'stone'
> 
> Same as intrusion 1 in every detail except tempo, which is constant, chosen and given by conductor, and articulation. Conductor gives upbeat and then 7 - 15 beats in no particular time signature. Players synchronise. Articulation is molto marcato. Repeat bottom note if you run out of notes.
> 
> Intrusion 3; hand symbol 'scissors'  
> Piano sostenuto  
> Choose any pitch from either scale  
> Sustain until brought off by conductor (tremolando if necessary)
> 
> Do not play two intrusions in the same way; pick different scales, pitches etc
> 
> Other points
> 
> The loud ensemble & assistant conductor should dress casually in ordinary clothes.
> 
> If possible recruit the loud ensemble and assistant conductor from out-of-work, semi-professional or student musicians; they are to be paid the same rates as the other ensemble, however.
> 
> If the ensemble are able to memorise the scalic materials and perform without music, so much the better.
> 
> It might be interesting to locate the assistant conductor within view of the loud ensemble, but out of sight of the other ensemble. Closed-circuit TV?
