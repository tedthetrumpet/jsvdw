Performance by Paddy Johnson, RSAMD Glasgow 21/6/07.

### Composer's note

Written at the instigation of spnm, for consideration by the cellist Arne Deforce; unfortunately he didnae like it. It's a performance piece, in the form of a theatrical scenario rather than a muscial score, and may well be the first cello quartet ever written to be performed by a solo cellist.

Duration 7'
