### About

'Straalvleugel' is a Dutch word I have made up; it means something like 'jetwing'. The piece was commissioned by Mariska Postma to play at a concert in Warga, Friesland in September '01, which also featured the first performance of [Seven Lies Regarding the Nature of Existence](lies) for sax quartet.

A fast and flighty piece; quite a challenge for both players!
