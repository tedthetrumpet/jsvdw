### Composer's note

**Black Sunbird** _Nectarinia amethystina_

> A very active and restless bird, continually on the move, with a loud persistent call. Sometimes sits for an hour or more inside a bush or creeper calling monotonously the whole time.
> 
> McLachlan & Liversidge _Robert's Birds of South Africa_ (Third ed.) Cape Town 1970 p.537

This piece was originally conceived for two electric violins, electric viola and electric guitar, but then I decided to be practical and score it for string quartet with optional electronics. This revised version for invention ensemble has allowed me to put the melody back onto electric guitar where it belongs; this is now the definitive version.
