## 1/11/99 for didgeridu & band

![Dialog sketch](/img/dialog.png "Dialog sketch")

### Composer's note

This was written for a group in Switzerland, to play at a concert on 1/1/2000; they suggested the interesting and unusual combination of didgeridu and symphonic wind band. Because of the nature of the occason, I decided to include a text in the piece, in a spirit of hope for the new millenium. It is taken from the Universal Declaration of Human rights;

> 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.'

The piece itself is quite straightforward, funky even; the didge is mainly used to set up rhythms which propel the piece along. Hidden under the hood are some deliberate modernist touches, including, unusually for me, some serialism.

### Notes
