## 6/07/07 for clarinet, piano and hang

### About

A rather over-intellectual piece of which little documentation survives, beyond a 'video score' of the hang part and the three deliberately contradictory programme notes below.

Composed for the International Conference on Music Since 1900 at York in 2007; devised in collaboration with and performed by Panayiotis Demopoulos (piano), Jonathan Sage (clarinet), and Salil Sachdev (hang).

Duration ~13'

#### Composer's note (1)

You see, I don't really _do_ calls for scores any more. I mean, ok, I use notation, but it's hardly the point, is it? It's about providing a service, not a product; the score is not the work, the _work_ is the work, a particular performance at a particular time and place. And, this one was an _anonymous_ call for scores! It's like you're not only dead but buried in an unmarked grave!

Of course, it _can_ be done; I have often resorted to 'notating' complex, nonlinear, open, performative, theatrical, multimedia works, as many composers have done. By using a hotchpotch of aleatoric strategies, diagrams, verbal explanations and so forth, it's _possible_ to jump through the score-based hoop, and produce a closed, dead 'piece' which can be defended in a musical court of law as constituting the complete specification of the work.

But it's all so tedious! Compared to just turning up and _telling_ the players where I want them to move to in the space, or _asking_ them how they feel about reading out some text, or _trying out_ a passage where the players have metrically uncoordinated material, or _experimenting_ with devised material using given scales, or _teaching_ them a rhythmic phrase. This is now the way in which I write music.

#### Composer's note (2)

The programme note given for J. Simon van der Walt's 'L'auteur n'est pas mort' is incorrect, it should read;

> 'L'Auter est mort' is a lighthearted romp through the history (and future!) of music, through the eyes of three colourful musical characters - a merry jumble of haunting melodies and jazz breaks, with a few raspberries blown in the direction of so-called 'modern' music along the way!

#### Composer's note (3)

"Ladies and gentlemen, most of you will I'm sure by now be aware of the unfortunate circumstances surrounding - well, anyway obviously the composer will not be with us tonight. In addition, earlier this evening I discovered an email from Simon, sent shortly before his tragic - em - anyway, it transpires that the programme note printed in the conference brochure is - um - mistakenly, the wrong one, so, as a mark of - em - I'll read the correct programme note;

> 'L'auteur n'est par mort' offers a playful recontextualisation of competing social and historical constructions of musical space and time, outlining a critique of unquestioned assumptions surrounding the notions of 'concert' and 'composer', by proposing an ironic new reading of genre-as-marginalisation through a semiotic and syntactical treatment of C. Hubert Parry's 'The Evolution of the Art of Music', David Raksin's score for 'Laura' (1944), and the heuristic folksonomies - of Kylie Minogue.
