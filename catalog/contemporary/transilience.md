### Composer's note

...or the trans-silliness of Simon's titles. In three parts, of which two are presently complete;

1. **Go on, break a hammer!** (piano; may be performed seperately)
    
2. **Prayer**

'Pelog' is one of two possible tunings used in Javanese gamelan music; it is an example of a transilient, or gapped, scale, from the Latin _transilire_, to leap across. 'Monsieur' is French for Mister.

Of course, the piece does not actually use the pelog scale, nor is it inspired in any way by gamelan music, nor is it at all French.
