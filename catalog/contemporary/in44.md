### 27/05/07 for string quartet

#### Composer's note

On the string quartet;

> _'the highest medium for a composer's thought'_ - Michael Kennedy _The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music_

> _'widely regarded as the supreme form of chamber music'_ - Cliff Eisen _Grove Music Online_

> _'a favoured medium through which composers could establish their more serious thoughts. For this reason ... it tends to come up quite frequently in exams.'_ - Bruce Cole _The Composer's Handbook_

> _'... maintains the dichotomy of sophisticated entertainment and highly intimate, quasi-self-revelatory musical utterances'_ - Otto Karolyi _Introducing Modern Music_

> _'It's in 4/4'_ - J. Simon van der Walt

#### Notes

Written for the Dalhousie Quartet, who never got around to playing it. (Perhaps not surprising given what an odd piece it is; in two movements, the second of which is to be improvised, devised or composed by the quartet on the model of the first movement. <!-- Check out the [score](http://tedthetrumpet.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/in4-4.pdf).) -->
