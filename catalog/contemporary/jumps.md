### Composer's note

The title is taken from a chapter in W.A. Mathieu's 'The Musical Life' in which he discusses music and words;

> Music is entirely specific: what you hear is what you get. Language is rich and various and inexact. You have to keep saying what is, a thousand ways, until someone jumps.

W. A. Mathieu _The Musical Life_ (Shambala 1994) p. 33
