#### Composer's note

'Bridge River Valley' was the first piece I wrote during my residency at the Banff Centre. It was sparked off by a conversation with playwright Norah Ashmore, who was working on a piece set in the actual [Bridge River Valley,](http://www.bridgerivervalley.ca/) in British Colombia. An important event in the story is the building of the first road in the 1950s; the short first movement of the piece was inspired by thoughts of journeying. The second movement seems to have no connection with ideas from play; it is simply an uptempo movement to balance the slow opening.
