## 12/6/98 (revised) for four flutes

![](/img/azure.png "azure")

### Composer's note

The original 'flute mafia' were four friends of mine who had a quartet at Napier University at the same time as I was there, 1990-1992. I liked the sound of four flutes, and decided to write them a blues; each individual part was written in an attempt to reflect their personalities as I saw them at the time.

A light and entertaining piece, with a few silly musical quotes thrown in for fun. The original quartet never actually performed in public; they couldn't stop laughing for long enough!

### Notes

First performance (revised version) Napier University 2000

Duration ~3'50
