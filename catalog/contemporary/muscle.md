## 13/2/03 for soprano saxophone & piano

### Composer's note

The glory of physical culture! Gleaming, sweaty torsos, pounding muscles, pushing harder, harder, towards that perfect self, made flesh! The vaunting ambition, the exercise machine, the mirror; even a gentle ride down a country lane on a rickety bicycle becomes a battle with time & age.

And how good it feels afterwards!
