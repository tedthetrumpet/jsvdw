### Composer's note

A couple of years ago I was in a tour bus on the way back from London, listening absently to a football match commentary coming from the television in the rear lounge. It sounded strange & stilted; the commentator paused in odd places, & seemed to have a rather small repertoire of phrases, some of which he repeated verbatim. Suddenly I twigged; it wasn't a real match, it was two people playing a video football game. I never play computer games on principle; evidently the technology had moved on to the point of having pre-recorded phrases spoken by a professional football commentator, roughly linked to the action in the game.

The effect was interesting, and I sat and transcribed a couple of minutes of the mechanical phrases, together with an indication of the length of the pauses between them, with the vague idea of making a piece.

Then it occurred to me to wonder how the computer knew whether the players were male or female. 'Stupid', I thought a moment later, 'of course it's assumed that the players are male'. Following this train of thought, I tried changing 'he' to 'she', which gave the text a whole new meaning. From here on the piece wrote itself.

### Text

… and off she goes, she can't score from here\
… and she's not afraid to take play… and she doesn't have room for a shot\
… that never looked on target
… I think she'll kick this as far as she can upfield\
… and the referee reaches for her yellow card ooh, the challenge looks even worse in sl-o-w 
m-o-t-i-o-n\
… she'll be wanting to target the ball further up field\
… oh, there's a nice touch\
… how can you explain that?\
… and she's looking for someone in the box and she's looking for someone upfield\
… now crazy challenge here\
… ooh, the challenge looks even worse in sl-o-w m-o-t-i-o-n\
… into the closing period of this match\
… she knows that a second yellow card means a sending off\
you can see the frustration in her face yes\
the referee was quite right to send her off\
… she must score from here\
… and off she goes
