### Composer's note

At the time I wrote this piece I was doing a lot of thinking and reading about the philosophy of science, Post-modernism, cultural relativism, and pseudo- and anti- science. (see Bibliography). The piece is in some way a reflection on these ideas; the title is a clue to the direction of my thinking.
