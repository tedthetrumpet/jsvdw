### Composer's note

_Ha!_, according to Chamber's dictionary can mean 'surprise, joy, exultation, dismay, enquiry, scepticism, encouragement, hesitation, and when repeated, laughter'. In this case, you might imagine that the players had finally managed to put together some kind of tricky puzzle.

### Notes

First performance by the **Goldberg Ensemble** Saturday February 15 2002 in Manchester (recording above), with a second performance in Wolverhampton on Thursday February 28.

Duration 12'30
