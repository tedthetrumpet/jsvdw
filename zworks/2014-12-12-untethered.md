### 12/12/14 with Gamelan Naga Mas

A collaborative performance, combining gamelan with other instruments, spoken word and visuals, exploring our relationship with the cosmos. As a composer and video artist I contributed the piece ‘Formica’ shown above, as well as arranging Sun Ra’s ‘We Travel the Spaceways’ for gamelan, voice, trumpet, melodica and two flutes.

#### Notes
